# Example: hostPath mount on macOS with Colima (single-node)
#
# Notes
# - hostPath refers to the Colima VM's filesystem. Colima (Lima) exposes your macOS home under /Users by default.
# - Use an absolute path under /Users/... that exists on your Mac.
# - This is for development only; prefer a PVC for production.
# - Set DSXCONNECTOR_ASSET explicitly to your intended source path semantics.
# - For quarantine moves, either use a subfolder under the same mountPath or enable quarantineVolume below.

scanVolume:
  enabled: true
  # Path on the Colima VM (macOS path under /Users is mounted by default)
  hostPath: "/Users/yourname/scan-data"   # CHANGE ME to a real path on your Mac
  # Path inside the connector container where files will appear
  mountPath: "/app/scan_folder"
  readOnly: false

quarantineVolume:
  enabled: true
  hostPath: "/Users/yourname/scan-data/dsxconnect-quarantine"  # CHANGE ME
  mountPath: "/app/quarantine"

# Optional: keep a small writable data dir inside the pod
dataVolume:
  enabled: true
  mountPath: "/app/data"

# Example helm install (adjust release name, version, and path):
#   helm install fs oci://registry-1.docker.io/dsxconnect/filesystem-connector-chart \
#     --version <chart-version> \
#     -f connectors/filesystem/deploy/helm/volume-mount-examples/hostpath-macos-colima.yaml
