# Connector Deployments (Helm) — Overview

All connectors (and the dsx-connect core stack) are packaged as Helm charts and published to Docker Hub as OCI artifacts.

Start here:
- [Kubernetes Deployment Best Practices](../kubernetes/getting-started.md)
- [Advanced Connector Deployment (pulled charts + GitOps)](../kubernetes/advanced-connector-deployment.md)

Then pick a connector-specific guide under **Deployment → Kubernetes Deployment → Connector Deployments (Helm)**.
